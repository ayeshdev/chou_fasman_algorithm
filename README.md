# Chou-Fasman Protein Structure Prediction Tool

## Overview
This Java Swing application implements the Chou-Fasman algorithm to predict the secondary structure (α-helix, β-sheet, coil) of a given amino acid sequence.

## Features
- Accepts an amino acid sequence as input.
- Predicts the secondary structure based on the Chou-Fasman propensity table.
- Displays the prediction in the result area.

## Requirements
- Java JDK 11 or higher
- Any Java IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, etc.)

## How to Run
1. Copy the project.
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE.
3. Run the `Main.java` class to launch the Swing application.
4. Enter an amino acid sequence (e.g., `MADEEKLPPGWEKRMSAAEEIRAGEAGVGIVNSGQGMVVTNVHNLQEDKLFGLFGGGSGASGDR`).
5. Click the **Predict Structure** button to see the secondary structure prediction.
